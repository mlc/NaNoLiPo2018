# NaNoLiPo Autolipo
See [ohjann's repo](https://github.com/ojahnn/NaNoLiPo2018) for the original. I will, day by day, convert each prompt into #autolipo form, each constraint complying with its own instructions.

# The Prompts
* Nov. 1: **#avoidlipo**

    Start off with a fairly comfy constraint. It's a day for imitating our old Oulipo pal, Anton Vowl. That most common symbol, our fifth if going from A to Z: don't put it in your writing. Not today, for NaNoLiPo; not any day, for [oulipo.social](https://oulipo.social/).
